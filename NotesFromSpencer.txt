==================== 10.2.12 notes ===

be sure to fix all warnings





==========================
Your project description looks great. I think it will be challenging but not too hard.

comments on the code I see here:

- write comments for classes and methods as you write the code (or before you write the code).
  - in addition to helping the reader understand your code, these comments can help you clarify what you are doing too.
  - use JavaDoc format
  - good comments are essential
  - good comments aren't too long. you don't have to comment every line. a good comment will tell the reader why code is
   written in a certain and explain stuff that is not obvious in the code itself.

- use whole words for variable names.
- Don't use single letters for notation e.g. PPages. The presentation package indicates that first P well enough. Same note
 for BL

Feel free to check in the web app framework.

Please consider using selenium http://seleniumhq.org/ and junit style tests to test your web.
If this ends up being too much work for you guys, I understand, but it would be great to see some selenium tests for this project.

Looking good.

Thanks, Spencer
